This Project is a combination of android:

8.recycler view
9.kotlin
10.room
11.unit test
12.coroutines
13.viewbinding
14.bottom sheet dialog
15.constraintLayout

The UI is very basic and we can still makes lots of improvements for example we can define style and use style for ui i tried to test my app both in vertical and horizontal mode but still it might not work well if
user,use android accessibility features.
we can add different animations for example fragment transitions.
we can also extract all hardcoded strings(I did my best not to hardcode...)and prepare a multilingual app.
Also we can create a version to handle night mode or Generally,a better UI/UX design.

The app is over-designed for the scope of this project but i decided to create it like that to show off my skills :)
